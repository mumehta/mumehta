## 🔧 About Me

**AI-First Engineer** | **I Don’t Just Build Features — I Design Systems Where Humans and AI Collaborate.**

I’m currently working as a **Senior DevOps Engineer at Service NSW**, where I streamline CI/CD pipelines, optimize cloud infrastructure, and lead security automation efforts. With 20 years of experience across software development and DevOps, I bridge business needs and engineering with hands-on delivery.

I’ve built secure, cost-effective platforms using AWS, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, and Terraform — and I’m always looking for ways to improve developer experience and deployment velocity.

I identifies myself as someone 
- 🔥 Who is Full Stack Developer Who Codes Like an Engineer, Thinks Like a System Designer, and Works Like a Founder.
- 🚀 I Don’t Fear AI — I Architect It. Supervised, Reliable, Production-Ready.
- 💡 I Don’t Ship Code — I Ship Intelligent, Maintainable Systems That Make AI Make Sense.
- 🛠️ Built the Frontend, Tamed the Backend, and Now I’m Teaching AI to Be a Team Player.
- ⚙️ From Figma to Flutter to Fine-Tuned AI — I Turn Chaos into Clean, Scalable Software.
- 🧠 Full Stack by Trade. AI-Native by Mindset. Remote-Ready by Design.
