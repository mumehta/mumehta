## 🔧 About Me

I’m currently working as a **Senior DevOps Engineer at Service NSW**, where I streamline CI/CD pipelines, optimize cloud infrastructure, and lead security automation efforts. With 20 years of experience across software development and DevOps, I bridge business needs and engineering with hands-on delivery.

I’ve built secure, cost-effective platforms using AWS, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, and Terraform — and I’m always looking for ways to improve developer experience and deployment velocity.
